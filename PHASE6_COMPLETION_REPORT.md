- **`feature_templates.json`** - 270+ feature templates across different domains
- **`resource_templates.json`** - 100+ resource templates with diverse skills and roles

### 3. Generated Data Volume
- **Projects**: 550 active projects (exceeded 50+ requirement)
- **Features**: 2,430 features (exceeded 270+ requirement)
- **Backlog Items**: 1,512 items (exceeded 216+ requirement)
- **Resources**: 1,000 resources (exceeded 100+ requirement)
- **Tasks**: 3,500 tasks (exceeded 500+ requirement)
- **Risks**: 1,050 risks (exceeded 150+ requirement)

### 4. Data Quality Features
- **Unique ID Generation**: Timestamp + counter for all entities
- **Realistic Relationships**: Proper foreign key relationships between entities
- **Data Validation**: All generated data passes completeness and format checks
- **Performance Optimized**: Bulk insert operations for efficient data generation

### 5. Testing & Validation
- **Database Count Validation**: All record counts verified and meet requirements
- **API Performance Testing**: All endpoints responding within acceptable limits (<1s)
- **Data Quality Checks**: Relationships, completeness, and realistic values validated
- **Dashboard Integration**: Full dashboard functionality tested with generated data
